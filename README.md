Hello Everyone,
I have done a project which I have named as Dental Cavity Detector Bot.
At first, I have observed that people now-a-days are very worried about their Dental related problems.Most of the people in this 21st century are facing these type of problems due to change in 
lifestyle,food,environment and many other factors.
So I would like to let them know whether they have any dental related problems or not.
In this project, I have used python programming languauge and telegram bot father also for accessing our own bot.
Finally you need to give the input as image of your tooth or teeth.The image can be of any size as your wish & it can be mobile clicked photo or even your teeth or tooth x-ray.
Then it will analyze whether your teeth or tooth was having any cavity or other damages and give you a reply whether cavity is present or not.
With this, you can check whether you have  any dental problems or not easily at home.
In future,I would like to enhance this project by adding many other features and output tasks etc..
Thank you.
